# תַּרְאוּ (Taru) - Website Copy Brief

## Product Name
**תַּרְאוּ** (Taru) - Hebrew for "You will see"

## What is it?
Taru is a civic consensus platform for Israeli municipalities. It lets citizens vote on local affairs with real verification - blockchain-recorded votes, GPS location pinning to verify you're a resident, and financial authentication to ensure one-person-one-vote. Think of it as finally giving residents a real voice in municipal decisions, with receipts.

## The Problem We Solve
Israeli residents are disconnected from municipal decisions that affect their daily lives. City councils make decisions behind closed doors. Public hearings are theater. WhatsApp groups rage but nothing changes. People feel powerless, cynical, and disengaged from local democracy.

Meanwhile, municipalities claim they "consulted the public" based on 12 people showing up to a Tuesday afternoon hearing.

## Our Solution
Taru makes civic participation:
- **Easy**: Vote from your phone in 2 minutes
- **Verified**: Blockchain records every vote, GPS confirms residency
- **Accountable**: Results are public, transparent, and undeniable
- **Meaningful**: Municipalities commit to responding to consensus

## Target Audience

### Primary: The Frustrated Resident (30-55)
- Lives in Israeli municipality (starting with Tivon)
- Cares about local issues but feels powerless
- Has complained in WhatsApp groups
- Voted in national elections but skips municipal ones
- Skeptical of "another app" but desperate for change

### Secondary: The Civic Activist (25-45)
- Already engaged in local causes
- Organizes neighbors, attends hearings
- Frustrated that efforts don't translate to change
- Looking for tools to amplify impact
- Will champion the platform if it works

### Tertiary: Municipal Officials
- Need genuine public input
- Want to show they're responsive
- Tired of being accused of ignoring residents
- Looking for legitimate consensus mechanisms

## Key Pain Points (from audience research)

1. **"My voice doesn't matter"** - Years of being ignored
2. **"I don't have time"** - Hearings at bad times, bureaucratic processes
3. **"I don't trust the system"** - Skepticism about whether votes count
4. **"Nothing ever changes"** - Cynicism from past failures
5. **"I don't know what's happening"** - Information asymmetry

## Key Desires

1. **Be heard** - Have genuine impact on decisions
2. **See results** - Transparent outcomes, not black boxes
3. **Save time** - Participate without disrupting life
4. **Feel part of community** - Connect with neighbors on issues
5. **Hold officials accountable** - Create undeniable public record

## Common Objections

1. **"Another app that won't work"** - Need to show traction, real results
2. **"Who's behind this?"** - Transparency about funding, intentions
3. **"Will the municipality actually listen?"** - Need commitment from officials
4. **"Is it secure?"** - Blockchain/verification needs simple explanation
5. **"Why should I pay?"** - ₪1 per vote, ₪50 to create vote - justify value

## Competitive Landscape

- **WhatsApp groups**: Lots of noise, no action, no accountability
- **Facebook groups**: Same problems, algorithmic manipulation
- **Municipal websites**: Outdated, one-way communication
- **Public hearings**: Inaccessible, performative
- **Petitions (Atzuma.co.il)**: Signatures without verification, easy to ignore

**Our differentiation**: Verified identity + recorded votes + geographic proof = undeniable consensus

## Brand Voice & Tone

### Voice
- **Direct**: No bureaucratic language
- **Empowering**: "You" focused, not "we" focused
- **Honest**: Acknowledge the cynicism, don't dismiss it
- **Local**: Feel like a neighbor, not a corporation

### Tone
- Confident but not arrogant
- Urgent but not alarmist
- Hopeful but not naive
- Simple but not dumbed-down

### Avoid
- Corporate speak ("leverage", "synergy", "stakeholders")
- Overpromising ("revolutionary", "game-changing")
- Condescension ("finally, a solution for you")
- Tech jargon without explanation ("blockchain" without context)
