# Forge — Target Users

## Primary Audiences

### 1. Solo Founders & Indie Hackers
- Building products alone, wearing every hat
- Need marketing copy, landing pages, pitch decks but can't afford a copywriting team
- Currently: prompt ChatGPT, get generic output, iterate 10 times, settle for "good enough"
- Pain: no one to challenge their assumptions or offer a second perspective
- What they want: a virtual team that debates their messaging until it's sharp

### 2. Content Teams (Startups & SMBs)
- Small teams (1-3 people) creating high-volume content
- Need consistency across different content types
- Currently: one writer produces everything, editor gives surface feedback
- Pain: echo chamber — same voice, same blind spots, same angles
- What they want: diverse perspectives baked into the creation process, not bolted on as review

### 3. Creative Agencies
- Client work across industries they don't specialize in
- Need to ramp up on new domains fast
- Currently: assign a copywriter, they research for a day, write, get client feedback, revise
- Pain: expensive iteration cycles, generic first drafts, clients who say "this doesn't feel like us"
- What they want: domain-specific AI teams that already know the audience and argue about what works

### 4. Product Teams
- Validating messaging, positioning, feature naming
- Need to stress-test assumptions before committing
- Currently: run it by 3 people in Slack, get "looks good" or conflicting opinions
- Pain: no structured way to get rigorous feedback on messaging
- What they want: a repeatable process that catches weak positioning before launch

## What They All Share
- Frustrated with flat, single-voice AI output
- Know AI can do more but current tools feel like a fancy autocomplete
- Value quality over speed (but want both)
- Willing to spend 15 minutes watching a debate if the output is genuinely better
- Technical enough to use a CLI or open enough to try one
