# Forge — Competitive Landscape

## The Single-Agent Tools (What Everyone Uses Now)

### ChatGPT / Claude Direct
- One model, one voice, one perspective
- User must manually prompt for different angles ("now be a critic", "now be a marketer")
- No memory across a long session — context degrades
- No structure — conversations wander without phases or goals
- Output: whatever the model generates first. No debate, no stress-testing

### Jasper / Copy.ai / Writesonic
- Template-based AI copywriting
- Fill in fields, get output
- No deliberation, no multiple perspectives
- Marketing-speak factory — sounds AI-generated
- No customization of the "who" behind the writing
- Positioning: "AI writes your copy" (commodity)

### Crew AI / AutoGen / LangChain Agents
- Developer frameworks for multi-agent systems
- Require coding to set up agent workflows
- No built-in deliberation methodology
- No persona system with real personalities
- No floor management or conversation memory
- Positioning: "build your own agents" (infrastructure, not product)

## Where Forge Sits

Forge is NOT:
- A prompt wrapper (like Jasper)
- A developer framework (like CrewAI)
- A chatbot (like ChatGPT)

Forge IS:
- A deliberation engine with structured methodology
- Opinionated about HOW agents should debate (phases, floor control, memory)
- Focused on quality of output, not speed of generation
- A product, not a platform — works out of the box with real personas

## Forge's Unfair Advantages
1. **Methodology** — No other tool has structured deliberation phases with dialectic/socratic/adversarial modes
2. **Personas with personality** — Not just "Agent 1" and "Agent 2" but characters with ages, biases, communication styles, and domain expertise
3. **Memory that works** — Rolling summaries + decision tracking = agents that don't forget what they said 20 messages ago
4. **Floor management** — Priority queues, cooldowns, timeouts prevent the chaos that kills other multi-agent systems
5. **Goal anchoring** — Mode system keeps agents on task. Loop detection breaks circular arguments
6. **Production output** — Export to PDF, DOCX, HTML with branded templates. Not just chat logs
