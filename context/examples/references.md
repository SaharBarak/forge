## Headlines That Work

### Honest/Vulnerable
- "We don't know if this will work. But we want to try."
- "Tired of being disappointed? So are we."
- "No promises. Just honest effort."

### Action-Oriented
- "Your street. Your decision."
- "One minute. Three shekels. You did something."
- "Stop talking. Start voting."

### Community-Focused
- "Thought you were alone? So did your neighbors."
- "Together, we're louder."
- "19,000 residents. One voice."

### Data-Driven
- "The number that changes everything: 3.5%"
- "665 residents. That's all it takes."
- "Math, not magic."

## Structure Examples

### The Facebook Chaos Contrast
```
BEFORE: 200 comments, zero action
AFTER: 200 votes, official report to council
```

### The Math Breakdown
```
9,500 residents × ₪3 = ₪28,500 per vote
That's enough to hire experts, run campaigns, create real change.
```

### The Experiment Frame
```
What we know: People want to be heard.
What we don't know: If this tool will work.
What we promise: To try honestly and tell you what happens.
```

## Anti-Patterns (Avoid)

- "Join the revolution!" (too dramatic)
- "Together we'll change the world" (too vague)
- "Your voice matters" (overused, sounds hollow)
- "Be the change" (cliché)
- "Democracy in action" (abstract, meaningless)
