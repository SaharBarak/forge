# Master Copywriting Skills

## Web Copywriting Principles

### The Hierarchy of Attention
1. **Headline** - 80% of people only read this. Make it count.
2. **Subheadline** - Expands on headline, hooks the scanner
3. **First paragraph** - Confirms they're in the right place
4. **Body** - Delivers on the promise
5. **CTA** - Clear, single action

### The AIDA Framework
- **Attention**: Stop the scroll with pattern interrupt
- **Interest**: "This is for me" recognition
- **Desire**: Paint the after-state
- **Action**: Single, clear CTA

### The PAS Framework
- **Problem**: Agitate the pain they already feel
- **Agitation**: Twist the knife (ethically)
- **Solution**: Present relief

### The 4 U's of Headlines
- **Urgent**: Time-sensitive element
- **Unique**: Different from alternatives
- **Ultra-specific**: Numbers, details, precision
- **Useful**: Clear benefit

## UI/UX Writing

### Microcopy Rules
- **Buttons**: Start with verb ("Get", "Start", "Join")
- **Forms**: Label what they'll get, not what to enter
- **Errors**: Blame the system, not the user
- **Empty states**: Opportunity, not dead end
- **Loading**: Set expectations

### Scannability
- F-pattern for text-heavy pages
- Z-pattern for minimal pages
- Bullet points > paragraphs
- Bold key phrases
- One idea per paragraph

### Mobile-First Writing
- Front-load key information
- Shorter sentences (15 words max)
- Thumb-friendly CTAs
- Expandable details

## Visual Hierarchy & Typography

### Size Ratios (1.2 Minor Third)
```
H1: 2.5rem (hero headline)
H2: 2rem (section headers)
H3: 1.5rem (subsections)
Body: 1rem (16px base)
Small: 0.875rem (captions)
```

### Line Length
- Optimal: 50-75 characters
- Mobile: 35-50 characters
- Never full-width on desktop

### Whitespace
- Padding > cramming
- Group related elements
- Separate distinct sections
- Let CTAs breathe

## Conversion Psychology

### Loss Aversion
- "Don't miss out" > "Get access"
- "Stop losing" > "Start gaining"
- Limited time/availability (if true)

### Social Proof Types
1. **Numbers**: "Join 10,000+ users"
2. **Testimonials**: Real names, photos, specifics
3. **Logos**: Recognized brands/media
4. **Certifications**: Trust badges
5. **Activity**: "Sarah from Tel Aviv just signed up"

### Objection Handling
- Anticipate before they think it
- FAQ for common concerns
- Risk reversal (guarantees)
- "But what if..." sections

### Specificity
- "3,247 users" > "thousands"
- "Save 2.5 hours/week" > "save time"
- "₪1 per vote" > "affordable"

## Hebrew-Specific Copywriting

### RTL Considerations
- Visual flow right-to-left
- Numbers stay LTR
- Mixed English/Hebrew needs care
- Button alignment flipped

### Israeli Tone
- Direct is expected, not rude
- Informal > formal (usually)
- Humor appreciated but tricky
- Skepticism is default stance

### Hebrew Typography
- Heebo/Assistant for modern feel
- Larger font sizes (Hebrew is denser)
- More line-height needed
- Avoid justified text

## Website Section Patterns

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

### Weak Copy
- ❌ "Welcome to our website"
- ❌ "We are a leading provider"
- ❌ "Click here"
- ❌ "Learn more"
- ❌ "Submit"

### Strong Alternatives
- ✅ [Specific value prop]
- ✅ [Proof point instead of claim]
- ✅ "Get your free X"
- ✅ "See how it works"
- ✅ "Start free trial"

### Trust Killers
- Stock photos of handshakes
- "Lorem ipsum" anywhere
- Broken links/images
- No contact information
- Vague claims without proof
