# Issue #55 — Shared Drawing Board: Live Visual Consensus Canvas

**Link:** https://github.com/SaharBarak/forge/issues/55  
**Priority:** High — Epic from Sahar  
**Status:** New

## Summary

A shared drawing board that enables live visual consensus between agents and users. This is a priority epic requested directly by Sahar.

## Requirements

1. **Shared Canvas JSON State Format** — Define a JSON schema for canvas state (objects, positions, connections, annotations) that all agents can read/write collaboratively.
2. **ASCII Wireframe Renderer** — Render the canvas state as ASCII art for terminal-based viewing and interaction.
3. **TUI Side Panel Integration** — Integrate the drawing board as a side panel in the existing TUI, allowing users to view/edit alongside chat.

## Action Items for PM

- Break this epic into sub-tasks
- Assign frontend/TUI work to **forge-fe**
- Assign state format design and architecture to **forge-architect**
- Track progress under issue #55
