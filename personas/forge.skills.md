# Forge Project Domain Knowledge

## Product Overview
Forge is a developer tool (CLI + Electron desktop app) that helps copywriters, marketers, and founders write better copy by simulating their target audience through AI agent debates.

## Core Workflow
1. Define audience personas (e.g., "skeptical enterprise buyer", "budget-conscious CFO")
2. AI agents loaded with copywriting expertise represent each persona
3. Agents research online for competitor messaging, audience insights, industry data
4. Multi-round debate process: critique → propose alternatives → argue → rewrite → repeat
5. Loop continues until consensus and all personas approve
6. Export final copy, debate transcript, and iteration drafts

## Target Market
- Indie hackers/solo founders (building landing pages, need conversion copy, can't afford copywriters)
- Startup marketers (shipping fast, need messaging validation across segments)
- Developers who hate writing copy (want systematic, tool-like approach)
- Copywriters (want AI assistance beyond simple generation)

## Key Differentiators
- Audience-driven copy creation vs. generic AI generation
- Debate-based iteration vs. one-shot generation
- Real data research vs. hallucinated insights
- Multi-segment optimization vs. single persona targeting
- Developer-friendly CLI/desktop workflow
- Claude Code login integration
